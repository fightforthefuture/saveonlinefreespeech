            The Internet gives us freedom to speak our minds and seek out information. But a rogue federal agency is hellbent on eliminating net neutrality&mdash;legalizing censorship and letting government-sanctioned monopolies like Comcast decide what you can and can’t do online. <strong><span class="bold-text">They must be stopped.</span></strong>

              <textarea class="form-input form-text-area" name="action_comment" title="Letter" required>The Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) that protect freedom of expression and access to information on the Internet are extremely important to me. I urge you to protect them.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;I don't want government-sanctioned monopoly ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into "fast lanes" for companies that pay and "slow lanes" for the rest.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Now is not the time to let these giants censor what we see and do online.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Censorship on the Internet is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay&mdash;and slow lanes for everyone else&mdash;if the Open Internet rules are repealed. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer "fast lanes" to websites for a fee.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;But if some companies can pay ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the five most valuable companies in America, just to further enrich the government-created cable monopolies that are famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Monopolies like Comcast and AT&T will be able to impose a tax on every sector of the American economy.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for alternative voices and others who can't pay up, to be heard.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;So I'm also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II, and denounce Chairman Pai's plans. Do whatever you can to dissuade him.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Thank you!</textarea>

          <h2 class="argument-heading">The government is afraid of the Internet.</h2>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The Internet gives ordinary people unprecedented power. It’s helps us organize and hold institutions accountable. It lets us create the next big innovation in how we communicate, how we pay for things, or how we acquire knowledge. For the government, all of this is a major threat.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The FCC, a rogue government agency, is trying to undo the guiding principle of the Internet&mdash;net neutrality&mdash;to force everyone to get permission from monopolies like Comcast and Verizon before we put anything on the web. This will kill our online freedom and jeopardize the technological revolution forever.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The US has led the the technological revolution and we shouldn’t stop now. Net neutrality has been one of the most successful free market principles in the history of the world. It keeps the Internet open and lets everyone have a chance to compete on it. Without net neutrality the Internet would be more centralized and it would not be the dynamic, disruptive medium it is today.

          <h2 class="argument-heading">If they take away net neutrality, we’ll lose important freedoms.</h2>

              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Freedom of speech will be limited.</span></strong> Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon will be allowed to slow down or block websites and apps. Anything that is critical of these companies, or the politicians they support, could be censored without recourse. The Internet has allowed alternative voices to speed past mainstream media, but without net neutrality, censoring speech would be simple for big companies and their allies in the government.
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Information will be blocked.</span></strong> A "basic" Internet plan may only give you access to a small subset of sites and services. The Internet will look more like cable television… you only get to see what the media companies put in front of you. Small sites and services will have to go through powerful gatekeepers to compete with the big players. 
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Entrepreneurship will suffer.</span></strong> Because Internet service providers would be allowed to block competitors, and big incumbents could pay for priority access, investment in startups would be severely curtailed. The innovative tech economy will flee the U.S. market for other areas with more open Internet policies. America has been a global leader in online innovation because net neutrality has given startups and disruptors an even playing field. 
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Government-sanctioned monopolies will have all the control.</span></strong> Companies like Comcast and Verizon have corrupted the government to the point where they have basically developed a partnership. They will happily do the government’s bidding in exchange for continuing to operate as monopolies and quash out all competition. These are the same companies that are bending over backwards to enable the government’s mass surveillance of our private lives.
