            The Internet is the last bastion for freedom of speech and free markets. But a rogue federal agency is hellbent on eliminating net neutrality -- legalizing censorship and letting government-sanctioned monopolies like Comcast decide what you can and can’t do online. <strong>They must be stopped.</strong>

          <h2 class="argument-heading">The government is afraid of the Internet.</h2>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The Internet gives us power to speak our minds and seek out information. It lets us create the next big innovation in how we pay for things or how we communicate with each other. It’s helps us organize and hold institutions accountable. For the government, all of this is a major threat.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The FCC, a rogue government agency is trying to undo the guiding principle of the Internet -- net neutrality -- to force everyone to get permission from companies like Comcast and Verizon before we put anything on the web. This will kill our online freedom and jeopardize the technological revolution forever.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            The US has led the the technological revolution and we shouldn’t stop now. Net neutrality has been one of the most successful free market principles in the history of the world. it keeps the Internet open and lets everyone have a chance to compete on it. Without net neutrality the Internet would almost certainly have developed in a more centralized way and would not be the dynamic, disruptive medium it is today.

          <h2 class="argument-heading">If they take away net neutrality, we’ll lose important freedoms.</h2>
          <p class="argument-content">
            <strong>1- <span class="argument-highlight">Freedom of speech will be limited</span></strong> -- Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon will be allowed to slow down or block websites and apps. Anything that is critical of these companies, or the politicians they support, could be censored without recourse. The Internet has allowed alternative voices speed past mainstream media. But, without net neutrality, censoring speech is would be simple for big companies and their allies in the government.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            <strong>2- <span class="argument-highlight">Information will be blocked</span></strong> -- A "basic" Internet plan may only give you access to a small subset of sites and services. The Internet will look more and more like cable television… you get to see what the media companies put in front of you, and nothing else. Small sites and services will have to go through powerful gatekeepers to compete with the big players. 

          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            <strong>3- <span class="argument-highlight">Entrepreneurship will suffer</span></strong> -- Because Internet service providers would be allowed to block competitors, and big incumbents could pay for priority access, investment in startups would be severely curtailed. The innovative tech economy will flee the U.S. market for other areas with a more open Internet. America has been a global leader in online innovation because net neutrality has given startups and disruptors an even playing field. 
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            <strong>4- <span class="argument-highlight">Government-sanctioned monopolies will have all the control</span></strong> -- Companies like Comcast and Verizon have corrupted the government to the point where they have basically developed a partnership. They will happily do the government’s bidding in exchange for continuing to operate as monopolies and quash out all competition. These are the same companies that are bending over backwards to enable the government’s mass surveillance of our private lives.

          <h2 class="argument-heading">Conservative voices will suffer the most.</h2>
          <p class="argument-content">
            If this rule passes, conservatives would likely face disproportionate censorship because big ISPs tend be very liberal.
          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            <span class="argument-highlight">Comcast</span>, the biggest ISP in the country, owns and invests in a wide range of left-leaning media companies, including MSNBC, Vox, and Buzzfeed. The rules would make it possible for Comcast to slow down sites like the Daily Caller and Fox News that compete with their investments and their viewpoints.

          </p>
          <p class="argument-content">
            These ISPs are monopolies that could be broken up or forced by the government to follow special regulations. They have to keep the politicians happy, so they have deep incentives to restrict voices that criticize the government.
