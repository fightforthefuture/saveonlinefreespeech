            The Internet is essential to free speech and free markets. But, the FCC is about to change it forever by eliminating net neutrality -- legalizing censorship and letting broadband monopolies like Comcast decide what you can and can’t do online. Republican members of Congress can stop the FCC, and they will, if they hear from enough of us. Tell them now.

I urge you to call on the FCC to stop their vote to end net neutrality.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;I don't want government-sanctioned monopoly ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into "fast lanes" for companies that pay and "slow lanes" for the rest.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Now is not the time to let these giants censor what we see and do online.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Censorship on the Internet is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay&mdash;and slow lanes for everyone else&mdash;if the Open Internet rules are repealed. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer "fast lanes" to websites for a fee.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;But if some companies can pay ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the five most valuable companies in America, just to further enrich the government-created cable monopolies that are famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Monopolies like Comcast and AT&T will be able to impose a tax on every sector of the American economy.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for alternative voices and others who can't pay up, to be heard.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;So I'm also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II, and denounce Chairman Pai's plans. Do whatever you can to dissuade him.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Thank you!</textarea>

          <h2 class="argument-heading">The government is giving control of the Internet to just a few companies, and soon.</h2>
          <p class="argument-content">The Federal Communications Commission is caving to government-sanctioned monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon and trying to kill the basic principle of the Internet, called net neutrality. Once they do, these big Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be in charge of what gets seen on the Internet (and what gets blocked), how fast we see our favorite sites, and how much more we have to pay just to run our businesses online.</p>
          <p class="argument-content">The FCC's new chairman Ajit Pai — a former Verizon lobbyist — is planning to strike down the net neutrality protections that millions of Americans fought for in the next few months. Net neutrality says you get the entire Internet without blocking or interference. It is the free market principle that keeps the Internet open and lets everyone have a chance to compete on it.</p>
          <p class="argument-content">Without net neutrality, big ISPs like Comcast or Time Warner Cable can charge exorbitant fees for access to an Internet “fast lane,” or even censor web sites entirely. Ending net neutrality will force everyone to pay off companies like Comcast and Verizon before they can reach people on the web. This will kill the free market principles of the web. Period.</p> 
          <p class="argument-content">The ISPs also own TV, radio, movies, advertising, and web media conglomerates. Without net neutrality, these companies will be free to squeeze everyone else’s content out of the picture and further control America's access to information.</p>
          <p class="argument-content">Net neutrality has been portrayed as a partisan issue by globalist politicians who have received millions in donations from ISPs and media companies. But in reality, net neutrality is essential to protecting the Internet as a free market of ideas and competitive enterprise.</p>
          <p class="argument-content">Centralizing control of the Internet in the hands of a few government-backed monopolies would kill the Internet as the platform for innovation that it is. The U.S. has led the the technological revolution and we can’t let the FCC and ISPs stop us now.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="supporting-argument">
          <h2 class="argument-heading">If they take away net neutrality, we’ll lose important freedoms.</h2>

              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Freedom of speech will be limited.</span></strong>Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon will be allowed to slow down or block websites and apps. Anything that is critical of these companies, or the politicians they support, could be censored without recourse. The Internet has allowed alternative voices speed past mainstream media. But without net neutrality, censoring speech would be simple for big companies and their allies in the government. 
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Information will be restricted.</span></strong> A “basic” Internet plan may only give you access to a small subset of sites and services. The Internet will look more and more like cable television… you get to see what the media companies put in front of you, and nothing else. Small sites and services will have to go through powerful gatekeepers to compete with the big players. 
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Entrepreneurship will suffer.</span></strong> Because Internet service providers would be allowed to block competitors, and big incumbents could pay for priority access, investment in startups would be severely curtailed. The innovative tech economy will flee the U.S. market for other areas with a more open Internet. America has been a global leader in online innovation because net neutrality has given startups and disruptors an even playing field.
            </li>
            <li class="argument-content argument-list-content">
              <strong><span class="argument-highlight bold-text">Government-sanctioned monopolies will have all the control.</span></strong> Companies like Comcast and Verizon have corrupted the government to the point where they have basically developed a partnership. They will happily do the government’s bidding in exchange for continuing to operate as monopolies and quash out all competition. These are the same companies that are bending over backwards to enable the government’s mass surveillance of our private lives.
